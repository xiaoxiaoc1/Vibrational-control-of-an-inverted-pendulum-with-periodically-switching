# Vibrational-control-of-an-inverted-pendulum-with-periodically-switching
An inverted pendulum can be stabilized by injecting dithers without measuring its angle and using feedback control. This dither-injecting open-loop control method is called vibrational control. A periodical switching signal is scheduling the on-and-off sequence of the dither injecting, which helps save the consumed energy.

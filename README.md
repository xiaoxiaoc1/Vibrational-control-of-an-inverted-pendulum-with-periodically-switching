# Simulation codes
Vib_Controller: run it to generate system trajectories in the simulations.

SystemDynamics: dynamics model is defined here.

ParametersSheet: include parameters used in the simulations.

SwitchingSignal: define the switching signal used.

EnergyConsumption: compare energy consumption before and after using switching.

ANIMATION_IP2p: creat videos for the motions of inverted pendulum in the simulations.

rotation: define rotation matrix of inverted pendulum in different angles.

vib_amplitude: define the amplitude of dithers.

# Videos
InvertedPendulumSim: animations of the inverted pendulum stabilized by vibrational control with switching.

TrajectorySim: angular positions, velocity and switching signal in the simulations.

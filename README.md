# Simulation codes
Vib_Controller: run it for system trajectories of simulations.\n
SystemDynamics: dynamics model is defined here.\n
ParametersSheet: include parameters used in simulations.
SwitchingSignal: define the switching signal used.
EnergyConsumption: compare energy consumption before and after using switching.
ANIMATION_IP2p: creat videos for the motions of inverted pendulum in the simulations
rotation: define rotation matrix of inverted pendulum in different angles
vib_amplitude: define the amplitude of dithers
